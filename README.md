# Moving Day Countdown1

Application designed to calculate the days until my moving out from my parents' home. Built in JavaScript using the third-party library dayjs, which calculates the upcoming days to the eagerly awaited date symbolizing a new chapter in my life. The project was created in one evening and later enhanced for visual appeal.
