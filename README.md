# Moving Day Counter

Program designed to count the days until my moving out from my parents' home, which is set for September 1, 2024. Built in JavaScript using the third-party library dayjs, which calculates the upcoming days to the eagerly awaited date symbolizing a new chapter in my life. The project was created in a single evening and later enhanced for visual appeal.
